            <p>The Olympic Games (French: Jeux olympiques) are an important international event featuring summer and winter sports. 
                Olympic Games are held every leap year (every four years), with Summer and Winter Olympic Games taking turns. 
            </p>
            <p>Each seasonal games happens every four years. Originally, the ancient Olympic Games were held in Ancient Greece
                 at Olympia. The first games were in 776 BC. They were held every four years up until the 5th century AD. 
            </p>
            <p>The first "modern" Olympics happened in 1896 in Athens, Greece. People choose to play in the Olympics to represent 
                the country they are from. Over time the Olympics have become bigger. In old times, women were not allowed to compete,
                 but now everyone is allowed. The Winter Games were created for ice and snow sports. 
            </p>
            <p>The Paralympic Games were created for athletes with physical disabilities. As well, the Olympics became bigger with 
                 the addition of the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. World War I and World War II led to the cancellation of
                  the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. As the decision-making body, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible 
                  for choosing the host city for each Olympic Games. The IOC is also responsible for choosing what sports are in the 
                  games. 
            </p>
            <p>The celebration of the Games includes many rituals and symbols, such as Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening
                 and closing ceremonies. The first, second, and third place finishers in each event receive, respectively, gold, silver,
                  and bronze medals.
